A data analysis project on modeling life expectancy.

The goal of this project is to model life expectancy by finding the most suitable predictor that gives a model through the knowledge of regression. We have chosen several predictors from both individual health habit levels (daily calorie, fat, protein) as well as wider socioeconomic levels (GDP per capita, average years of schooling).

The analysis is done in R code, a detailed report is also written.
